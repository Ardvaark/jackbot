JackBot
=======

JackBot is an IRC bot written entirely from scratch in 100% pure Java. It is a pet project of mine, and a few of my friends have expressed interest in writing plugins for it.

Some interesting things it does:

 - Simple plugin-based architecture for adding new functionality.
 - Scripting in JavaScript, via the Mozilla Rhino JavaScript engine.
 - Twitter support.
