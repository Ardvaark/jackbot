2.0-SNAPSHOT - Work in Progress
* Updated to use Maven2.
* Updated to use modern Rhino versions.
* Massive code cleanup, to bring into the modern age.
* Integrated Classworlds, allowing for simple execution using java -jar.

0.1b - 2003-02-11
* Re-numbered to be consistent with current version numbering.
* Fixed Defect #606811 (+o feature does not handle "-" in nick)
* Fixed Defect #635250 (FSM for dance routine has too little "S")
* Fixed Defect #610352 (Bot ceases responding on bad connection.)
* Cleaned up thread synchronization code in flood control classes.

1.2.2 - 2002-07-17
* I /think/ I fixed the bug where the bot won't reconnect after losing the
  connection to the server.  This is a pesky one, though.

1.2.1 - 2002-07-14
* Fixed IllegalThreadStateException and shutdown when the connection to the
  server is lost.

1.2 - 2002-07-12
* Added a full event handler system.  Virtually ever IRC event is covered,
  including topic, nick, privmsg, and action.
* Added the Exec object for native execution.  This replaces the NativeExec
  object from v1.1.2.
* The multiple independed scopes per script capability has been removed.  It
  was not very useful, and it was a big pain to do correctly.

1.1.4 - 2002-06-13
* Added simple event handlers: onJoin, onPart, onKick, onQuit
* Added chain() to jacklib.js to allow function chaining.

1.1.3 - 2002-06-12
* Added an input thread.
* Implemented out-of-order message processing.
* Completed a very basic, but complete IOM (IRC Object Model).

1.1.2 - 2002-05-28
* Added native process execution via the NativeExec JavaScript object.

1.1.1 - 2002-05-09
* Added multiple independent scopes per loaded script.
* Added 'nick' property to the JavaScript 'bot' object.
* Added '!listscripts' command.
* Modified '!reload' command to work for any scriptnames listed by the
  '!listscripts' command.

1.1 - 2002-04-28
* Integrated Rhino JavaScript runtime, including event callbacks.
  This was the biggie.  Virtually everything has changed because of this,
  and the bot is indeed no longer fully functional out-of-the-box because
  much of the original functionality (such as authentication) need to be
  rewritten in script.
* Stripped guts out of event system, since it is no longer necessary
  with the scripting system.  Replaced with simplified model.

1.0 - 2002-02-12
Here we are at the beginning.
